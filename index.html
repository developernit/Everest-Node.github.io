					<h3>We are small but dedicated group of people from different parts of the world, the purpose of starting orchestrator was to dip the toes into the world of crypto but in the end we jumped all in. At the beginning, the investment seed for orchestrator stake was managed personally and the transcoding server run locally in EU but after realising the potential of livepeer for the future of video infrastructure, we started to expland rapidly. Starting with stake of 10 LPT about 6months ago, we managed to accumulate 180 LPT by the date of March 2022 and servers to handle transcoding service in almost all continents. We have accumulated total of 1.44 ETH from transcoding in L1 which has been reinvested into expansion but if you stake with us, the part of eth fees accumulated will be rewarded to you on the basis of reward cut percentage.</h3>
